# AttendanceManagementSystem
In most educational institutions the attendance is taken manually. It is not only time consuming, but it is also unsecure and unreliable and it can be lost. Some institutions are using punch card for attendance while this will be difficult for teachers to keep track of the large number of students because by using punch card, a student can help the other students or his/her friend to punch their card even the other student may be absent or come late in class, so it is not reliable.  To overcome these problems I have developed a better system which is Web based; it is fully responsive where a user can use in mobile, tablets and different computer systems. In this system records are kept safe and secure and the attendance information of particular or all students of particular class and can be accessed easily  and without  time consuming,  the report  is  generated  automatically.
